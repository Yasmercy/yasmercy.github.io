# Bio

Hey, I'm Ian Chen, studying Statistics and Computer Science as a third-year undergraduate at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign.

# Research

I'm currently working on Network Science with [Tandy Warnow](https://tandy.cs.illinois.edu/) and [George Chacko](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/chackoge).
I am interested in scaling local community detection, also known as community search, towards large networks and allowing for data discovery.
